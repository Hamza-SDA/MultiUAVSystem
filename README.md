# MultiUAVSystem
This system is just a test that has a 4 waypoint single UAV simulation and a WIP multi-UAV system. The current system involves using the PX4 multiUAV approach and has a simple collision avoidance system and simple formation.
Important note this system is still in development and uses much of the prebuilt knowledge from the PX4 starter guide. I am no genuis when it comes to using ROS.

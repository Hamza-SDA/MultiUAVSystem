# Before launching ROS, make sure that you are sourced into .bashrc and have place the following at the end.
# These next lines must be placed in you source file (your dirs might be different and you may need to alter these lines):

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source ~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/setup_gazebo.bash ~/PX4-Autopilot ~/PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/PX4-Autopilot
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_gazebo-classic
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-9/plugins

# Source the file:

home/.bashrc
source .bashrc

# Build the project

# Launch Simulation environment in separate terminals

roscore
roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14540@127.0.0.1:14557"
roslaunch px4 posix_sitl.launch

# In a third terminal, run the python node script for basic offboard launch

rosrun project single_node.py

# OR this for CPP node script

rosrun project startcpp_single



# To run the multi-UAV simulation

roslaunch project launchmultiUAVSim.launch

# Remember to catkin build when changing files

source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash


######## Final versions

# To run the new versions multi-UAV simulation

# You can launch with specified launch files

roslaunch project launchGazEnv.launch
roslaunch project launchUAV0.launch
roslaunch project launchUAV1.launch
roslaunch project launchUAV2.launch

# Or launching the UAVs with the condensed launch file with specifications on the uav_num as an argument
# This launch also allows the user to enter the location of each UAV as an argument

roslaunch project launchGazEnv.launch
roslaunch project launchUAV.launch uav_num:=ID x_pos:=x y_pos:=y z_pos:=0

# Where ID is the uav number from 0 to 2 and x, y, and z are the Gazebo positions. (z does not need to be set as it will always be set to 0 as default)

# Note: you cannot rosrun the drone_controller.cpp because it requires the argument for the uav_num set in the launch file.
